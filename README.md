## What is the Mia Snacc Dispenser?
The Mia Snacc Dispenser (MSD) is a passion project that I worked on that allows a user to see a live feed of their pet, and then press a button to dispense a treat.
I was motivated to build this device as multiple family members in our house moved away at around the same time, whilst our dog Mia stayed behind. The MSD allows all of my family members to see and interact with Mia regardless of where they are in the world and therefore feel a greater sense of connection.

## How does it work?
A Raspberry Pi Zero W is used to create the site interface along with a Raspberry Pi camera module to capture the live stream. The device is attached to the ceiling so that its contents are out of reach, and so that upon being dispensed, the treat will then drop down and be accessible.
