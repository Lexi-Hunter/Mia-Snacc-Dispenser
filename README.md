## What is the Mia Snacc Dispenser?
The Mia Snacc Dispenser (MSD) is a passion project that I worked on that allows a user to see a live feed of their pet, and then press a button to dispense a treat.
I was motivated to build this device as multiple family members in our house moved away at around the same time, whilst our dog Mia stayed behind. The MSD allows all of my family members to see and interact with Mia regardless of where they are in the world and therefore feel a greater sense of connection.
